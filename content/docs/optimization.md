## Query Optimization

Optimizing your queries can significantly enhance the performance of the Kolibrie database.

### Index Usage

Kolibrie automatically manages indexes to speed up query execution. The following index types are automatically maintained:

* **Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO)**: For subject-centric queries.
* **Predicate-Object-Subject (POS)**: For efficient predicate-based searches.
* **Object-Subject-Predicate (OSP)**: For queries centered around objects.

Proper query structure leverages these indexes effectively:

```rust
// No manual action required; indexes are auto-generated and maintained by Kolibrie.
```

### Query Planning

Kolibrie's query planner optimizes SPARQL queries through:

1. **Analyzing Triple Patterns**: Identifying the most selective patterns.
2. **Optimizing Join Orders**: Minimizing intermediate results for efficient joins.
3. **Cost Estimation**: Using statistics to estimate and minimize query execution costs.

## Performance Tuning

Optimizing resource use ensures high performance when handling large datasets.

### Memory Management

Kolibrie handles memory efficiently, particularly important for large datasets:

```rust
use kolibrie::sparql_database::SparqlDatabase;

let mut database = SparqlDatabase::new();
// Efficient parsing for large files

database.parse_rdf_from_file("large_dataset.rdf");
```

### Parallel Processing

For optimal performance, enable parallel processing:

**Multi-threaded RDF Parsing:**

```rust
database.parse_rdf_from_file(file_path);
```

**CUDA Acceleration:**

For GPU-supported parallel processing:

```rust
#[gpu::main]
fn main() {
    database.parse_rdf_from_file(file_path);
    // Queries benefit from GPU acceleration
}
```

## Best Practices

To achieve optimal performance:

1. **Use Specific Predicates**: Clearly defined predicates help the query planner utilize indexes effectively.
2. **Limit Result Sets**: Always use the `LIMIT` clause to reduce memory consumption and execution time.
3. **Structure Queries for Index Usage**: Design queries to leverage automatic indexing effectively.
4. **Batch Operations**: Perform batch inserts and updates to enhance operational efficiency.
